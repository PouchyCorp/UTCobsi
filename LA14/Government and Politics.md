Palace of Westminster : British Parliament

Two chambers :
House of Commons - Equivalent of Assemblée Nationale (reprentative assembly), they are MPs (Members of Parliament)
This is the most important chamber
> The Speaker of the House (comme le president de l'AN)
> MPs of the largest party are on the left 
> The Opposition is on the other side
> The Front bench and Opposition's front bench ?

Two red lines on the floor that forbid one side of crossing to the other
 650 constituencies (MPs)

House of Lords : for life (not elected)
88 Hereditary Peers (old aristocrats that transmit the seat to their children)
721 Life Peers (appointed by the government, not transmitted), these are important people for British society that receive the seat. not limited in count (technically ...)
23 Lors Spiritual (Senior bishops and archbishops)
The Lord Speaker
The cross benchers (neutral)
The royal Trown 

NOT like the Sénat, they dont have a veto but can delay a law for max a year, they advise the government
Their duty is to serve the interest of the people

The house of Lords's power was weakened a lot over the years (1911 - 1949)
A lot of debate today over the legitimacy of the House of Lords

Government :
Less powerful than Parliament
Seat of the Government in White

Prime Minister (PM) - 10 Downing Street
Appointed by the MPs
Larry the Cat <3
