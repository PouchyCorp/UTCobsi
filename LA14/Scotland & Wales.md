Part of the 4 nations of the UK

Is the UK really united ?
> Questionable
## Wales
>Capital : Cardiff
>Small Nation
>Originates from the Celts
>They are still a sort of "original celts"
>Welsh language is a direct decendant of celt
>Red Dragon : Symbol of Welsh

Offa's Dyke - Built to keep the welsh from raiding the Anglo Saxons
> Dyke = Digue
> Still roughly the boundary between England and Wales

The Normans: 
>They invaded a part of Wales

 Wales is NOT an united kindom / territory
Two Rivals : Edward I king of england VS Prince of Gwynedd prince of Wale
> Numerous rebellions because of English persecutions
> Edward finally conquered Wales
> Edward gave the title of Prince of Wales to his son **(still true today)**
>He built many castles to keep Welsh still
>Introduced Common Law

The king of England decided to abolish Wales as a nation because they remained catholic during the English Schism -> they converted to anglicanism 

Wales has a history of erasure (like scottland)
>They can not carry weapons
>They can not speak welsh
>They can not have welsh names
>They can not have government responsabilities
>Somes places forbid welsh people
>Blue Books : an english report to trash talk on welsh culture

### Today
Small but proud nation
National identity : 55% identify as welsh only
Focus on language and culture (we can see it clearly in the anthem)

The Round Table, The songs (in the Lord of the Ring)
The language is associated with fantasy

Party of Wales : Plaid Cymru (4 MPs)
The Tryweryn flooding -> negligence from Liverpool that destroyed a welsh village for water

Some power was given back to Wales with devolution in 1997.
> A Welsh Parliament : the Senedd (proportional representation)
> They could create regulations to implement Westminster's laws
> They are getting more and more power (Education, Health, Culture, Welsh language) (NOT justice, NOT policing, NOT rail infrastructure)

**However, They do not want independence

## Scotland
>Capital : Edinbrugh

### History
> Originally Celt
> Small Roman Invasion 1st cent
> Viking Invasion 9th cent
> They merged with the gaelics  

Invaded by the Normans 10th cent: 
- Signed a peace treaty
- Created a buffer zone like for wales

Alba -> Scotland

Edward the 1st was called to "arbitrate" the new king choice
> He invaded Scotland anyways
> Stole the Stone of Scone (1296)
> Battle of Stirling Bridge where the scots won (1297)
> More scott military wins after that

>The Pope declared Scotland as an independent kingdom : secured scotland's independence

### Act of Union 1707
The two parliaments voted to merge the two kindoms 

### Today
Highlands + Lowlands
65% indentify as scottish only
almost no one speaks gaelic anymore (/= Wales)

Proud of beating Edward the 1st
Loch Ness (monster ?)
Bag pipe
Burns Supper

**They where not given devolution even if they said yes to a referendum
They still got a *scottish parliament* that is fairly powerful

The scottish elections are meant to never get an absolute majority 
The SNP still managed an absolute majority 
> pushed for a scottish government and a referendum for independence : **NO**
> It still scared the UK government that "vowed" to give more devolution
> Scotland Act 2016
