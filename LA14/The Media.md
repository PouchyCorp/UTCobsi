### Two Categories : Quality Press / Tabloids (no equivalent in France)
Example for quality press : Times, Telegraph, Guardian (most are right wing)
Example for tabloids : The Sun, Daily Mail, Daily Star (most are right wing)

Physical newspapers are still bought a lot (50 50 online and physical)
Tabloids == Press People (chercheurs de buzz)

Tabloids are eurosceptics often and french bashing
They have often play on words and puns on the front page (classic british humour)

**The press is mostly free and self regulated (problematic, no regulations, they can lie)
They have few limitations, like court orders and national security
